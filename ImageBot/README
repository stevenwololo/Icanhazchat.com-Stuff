I've decided to open source parts of stevenbot that other people might find useful. This particular bot will allow a specific set of users to add / remove images which will be rotated periodically as the room background.

You can turn off image rotation if you want for some time, then turn it back on.

Currently, images are selected randomly so it might pick the same background twice, or pick the background previous.


Things you should do:
-> Edit the room_permamods array
-> Edit the bkground_images array


To start the bot:
-> type "/bot-start" in main chat
-> paste in the javascript code
-> run the bot
-> give moderator status to the bot if you haven't already


type !help if you want to get a list of the commands

Note: If you reboot your imagebot, the images added with !addbkground will no longer be there. There's ways of saving this, but I haven't played around with that yet.
